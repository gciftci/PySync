# PySync Speech Recognition

PySync is a speech recognition project focused on processing and classifying audio speeches using deep learning. This project aims to provide an efficient way to recognize and classify different speakers from their speech patterns.

## Description

PySync uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training neural network models to recognize different speakers. It processes audio files, converts them into a suitable format for training, and utilizes a deep learning model to classify the speakers.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Librosa (for audio processing)

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/pysync.git
```

### Setting Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing the Program

Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Help

Any issues or problems with running the program can be addressed by creating an issue in the GitHub repository.
